```
cd [YOUR LOCATION]/app/build
```
You can also copy and locate this folder anywhere inside Your server environment. The folder has not be called */tv2_app_slick*

## More details on how to build and run

1. To build this app, You need NPM installed globally and You have to use Your Terminal and make sure You are located to the main source directory where the **package.json** is located. Like so:

```bash

```

2. Run the app directly form source. Change the port in the .evn config, or use http://localhost:8080
